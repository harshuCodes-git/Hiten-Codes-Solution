- **`data/`**: Contains the original Hitencodes Excel sheet and any other relevant data files.
- **`scripts/`**: Contains any helper scripts or additional code used in the solutions.

## Installation

To run the solutions locally, you will need to have Python and a C++ compiler installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

### Python

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/harshuCodes-git/Hiten-Codes-Solution.git
    
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### C++

Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install `g++` using:
```bash
sudo apt-get install g++
```

### Usage

Each question's solution is located in its respective folder under the questions/ directory. You can navigate to the folder of the question you are interested in and find the solution files there.
For example, to view the solution for Question 1:

```
cd questions/question1

```

### Each solution will typically include:

- **`solution.md`**: A detailed explanation of the solution.
- **`solution.cpp`**: The C++ code implementing the solution.
- **`solution.py`**: The Python code implementing the solution.
Additional files as needed (e.g., data files, scripts).

### Running Python Solutions
You can run the Python scripts using

```
python solution.py

```
### Running C++ Solutions
To compile and run the C++ code, use the following commands:

```
